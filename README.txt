I have only been working on the SSH servers for the pytest assignment. I couldn't get it working then on SSH OSU servers, which I work on because of COVID-19
I got an install dependency error and the screenshot is here. Some students in the chat recommended using sudo the sudo command, which I did,
but it didn't work and then I wasn't able to do flake8 either. I am staying until the end of class and I will commit if I can get it working
